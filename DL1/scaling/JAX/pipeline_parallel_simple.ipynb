    "In the previous tutorial, we have seen data parallelism, which works well for intermediate large models and large batch sizes. However, as we continue to increase the model size, the batch size per device can become very small, which can lead to inefficient usage of the accelerators. This is because on the one hand, the time spent on communication between devices can become significant compared to the time spent on computation. On the other hand, small batch sizes can lead to poor utilization of the device's computational resources, since fewer operations can be performed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, we need to consider parallelism strategies that can parallelize the model itself, rather than the data. Such strategies can lead to strong utilization, even if the batch size per device is small. In this notebook series, we will consider two such strategies: pipeline parallelism and tensor parallelism. Intuitively, pipeline parallelism splits the model across layers, while tensor parallelism splits the model across feature dimensions. We visualize these strategies in the figure below.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will focus on pipeline parallelism. We will first discuss the concept of pipeline parallelism, and then show how to implement it in JAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline parallelism is a way to parallelize the forward and backward passes of a model across multiple devices. In comparison to data parallelism which replicates the model across devices, the model is instead split across its layers into multiple stages. Each stage consists of multiple layers of the model, and is placed on a different device. The output of each stage is passed to the next stage, and the final output is the result of the last stage. For example, consider a Transformer model with 12 layers and 4 devices. In this case, we can split the model into 4 stages, each consisting of 3 layers. The first three layers are placed on the first device, the next three on the second device, and so on. Given an input batch, we start by passing it to stage 1 on the first device. The output of stage 1 is then passed to stage 2, and so on, until the final output is produced by stage 4. The backward pass is performed in the reverse order, starting from the last stage and ending at the first stage. This way, each device only requires a subset of the model, reducing the memory requirements and allowing for larger models to be trained. At the same time, we introduce minimal communication between devices, as the output of each stage is only passed to the next stage. This leads to a computation graph similar as in the figure below ($F_i$ - forward pass of stage $i$, $B_i$ - backward pass of stage $i$, Update - optimizer step and gradient communication). We note that the precise timings may depend on additional factors, such as communication speed, cost of backward pass, additional data parallelism (especially for update step), etc. But for now, let's focus on the basic idea.\n",

    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding: 10px\"><img src=\"../figures/pipeline_simple.svg\" width=\"800px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the figure, we can see that the forward pass of stage 1 can start as soon as the first layer is computed, and the backward pass of stage 4 can start as soon as the last layer is computed. However, for a large amount of time, the devices are idle, as they are waiting for the output of the previous stage. This can lead to the **\"pipeline bubble\"** problem, where the utilization of the devices is reduced due to the time spent waiting for the output of the previous stage. In this notebook, we will discuss and implement simple strategies to mitigate the pipeline bubble problem, and show how this can be done efficiently in JAX."

    "## Pipeline Parallelism with Micro-Batching\n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy to mitigate the pipeline bubble problem is to use micro-batching, as introduced in GPipe \\[[Huang et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06965.pdf)\\]. The idea is to split the input batch into smaller sub-batches (micro-batches), and processing them sequentially. At the end of each micro-batch, we communicate the outputs between stages, and start processing the next micro-batch. This way, we can keep the devices busy while waiting for the output of the previous stage, and reduce the pipeline bubble problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a batch of size 32, and a pipeline with 4 stages. We can split the batch into 4 micro-batches (or any other factor of 32), each of size 8, and process them sequentially. As soon as the first micro-batch is processed by stage 1, we can communicate the output to stage 2, and start processing the second micro-batch, as so on. The figure below shows the computation graph for the forward and backward passes of the pipeline with this micro-batching strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding: 10px\"><img src=\"../figures/pipeline_microbatch.svg\" width=\"800px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the original pipeline, we can see that the devices are kept busy for a larger portion of the time, as they are processing the micro-batches sequentially. However, we also note that the communication between stages is now more frequent, as we need to communicate the output of each micro-batch. This can lead to increased communication overhead, especially for small micro-batches. In practice, the choice of the micro-batch size is a trade-off between the pipeline bubble problem, the communication overhead, and the max utilization we can achieve per device with this micro-batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will show how to implement pipeline parallelism with micro-batching in JAX. We will use a simple MLP model for demonstration (to make it feasible on CPU), and show how to split the model across stages. For any other model such as larger Transformer, the same principles apply and can be implemented without changes to the pipeline wrapper below."

This way, we can easily split the parameters across devices, and use the same model definition for all stages.\n",

    "### Pipeline Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline implementation is iterating over two simple steps: applying the stages per device on a micro-batch, and communicating the last output between devices to get the next input. Whenever there is no proper input ready, we still run the stage to follow the SPMD principle (single program multiple devices), but ignore the output. Our communication is performed using `jax.lax.ppermute` which transfers an array over a ring: stage 1 sends its output to stage 2, stage 2 to stage 3, stage 3 to stage 4, and finally, stage 4 to stage 1. The last communication between stage 4 and stage 1 can be ignored, as it is only used to close the ring and stage 1 uses the original micro-batches as input. Instead, we store the last $N$ outputs of stage 4 and use them for the loss calculation in the final layers, since those are the outputs of the full model. In summary, the computation graph for the forward pass will look similar as in the figure below:\n",

    "With the single step implemented, we can now wrap it in a `nn.scan` operation to iterate over the micro-batches. Compared to the scan over layers in the `MLPLayers` module, we now scan over the micro-batches, and keep the parameters the same. The latter is controlled by setting `variable_broadcast` to `{\"params\": True}`, and not splitting the params RNG over iterations. To scan over the input and output, we add `in_axes=0` and `out_axes=0`, which effectively unstacks the input and stacks the output over the first axis across iterations. In other words, the first iteration get the first micro-batch as input, the second iteration the second micro-batch, and so on. Additionally, the current `state` of the stages is communicated as a carry, which is passed between iterations. \n",

This way, we can use our `execute_pipeline_step` function with the `nn.scan` operation. This results in the following pipeline function:"

    "The pipeline structure assumes that each stage has the same layers and structures. However, commonly, we have an input layer, mapping the input to the first stage, and an output layer, mapping the output of the last stage to the final output. We can easily combine the pipeline model with these layers by using the pipeline model as a sub-module. We can then define the input and output layers as usual, and use the pipeline model to process the intermediate features. \n",

    "Depending on the cost of the input and output layers, we can also consider to split them across devices. This is particularly of interest if the communication cost is comparatively low on the available devices. For instance, we could perform a data-parallel strategy over the model axis for the input layer and gather all outputs on the first device before executing the pipeline. However, for setups like language models, where the input layer mainly consists of an embedding lookup, the communication between devices may become more expensive than performing the lookup on a single device, or we may consider a tensor parallel approach (more on it in the next notebook). For simplicity, in this notebook, we will duplicate the computation of the input and output layers on all devices, and ignore the outputs of the input layers on all devices except the first one. Duplicating the weights across model devices would lead to unnecessary communication overhead during the optimization step, and we instead set all weights that are unused on certain devices to zero. Hence, the optimizer step will not change the weights on the unused devices, and we can avoid the communication overhead. We have already implemented this strategy in the `ModelParallelismWrapper` by supporting the `mask_except_model_idx` argument. For the input layer, we mask all model devices besides the first one, and for the output layer, we mask all model devices besides the last one."

Thus, our full model will consist of a linear input layer, the pipeline model, and a final norm plus the linear output layer. For language models, the input layer may be an embedding layer combined with positional embeddings, and the output layer may be the same as shown here, just applied on a per-token basis."

The training step is very similar to the previous notebook, with the main difference being that we now consider only the last model device to calculate the loss. Note that, for more expensive output layers, one could also consider to scatter the pipeline outputs over the model axis and calculate the loss of each sub-batch on all devices and average the results. This would lead to a more balanced computation load, but also to a higher communication overhead. For simplicity, we will stick with the last device for the loss calculation, such that we can ignore the losses on the other devices.\n",

For other random operations, we may want to fold the RNG key only over one of the two axes, depending on the operation and the desired behavior."
